## Abstract

We implemented three designs in this project: a generic 4-to-1 mux,
an 8-bit shift register, and a 4-bit add/subtractor. All designs are
implemented in gate-level RTL designs using synthesizable VHDL constructs
such that they could be used to program FPGA chips with these designs.

All of our designs ran conclusive testbenches for corner cases and general
case problems.

## Division of Labor

The project has three main sections, each with two tasks. Each design
(mux, register, and adder), requires both a VHDL implementation and
a test bench. Zach and Collin worked together to write the logic design,
while Collin wrote the VHDL implementation for the mux and register,
Zach wrote the VHDL implementation for the adder. The two wrote test benches
for the designs they did not implement.
